I need to summarize a conversation. The transcript of the conversation is between the <data> XML like tags.

<data>
{{transcript}}
</data>

First, identify the main topics or themes discussed in the conversation. Each topic must be no more than 30 characters in length.

The summary must contain a one-word sentiment analysis, and a list of issues, problems or causes of friction during the conversation. For each issue, assign a topic from the topics you identified (each topic string must be at most 30 characters).

The output must be provided in JSON format shown in the following example.

Example output:
{
    "version": 0.1,
    "sentiment": "<one word sentiment>",
    "topics": ["<topic1>", "<topic2>"],
    "issues": [
        {
            "topic": "<topic from your list, max 30 chars>",
            "summary": "<issue_summary>"
        }
    ]
}

Write the JSON output and nothing more.

Here is the JSON output:
